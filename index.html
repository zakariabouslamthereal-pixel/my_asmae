        <p>I wanted to make something for you as we start this new year. Not because I had to, but because you matter to me.</p>
        <p>I know things haven't always been easy for you. I know there's stuff from your past that still comes up sometimes. But I want you to know that none of that defines who you are now.</p>
        <p>You're here. You made it through. And that takes real strength.</p>

      <div class="section-text">
        <p>When I think about you, I don't see someone who needs fixing or saving. I see someone who's already done the hard work of healing themselves.</p>
        <p>You're kind without being naive. You're strong without being hard. You managed to keep your heart open even when life gave you reasons to close it off.</p>
        <p>That's rare, and I don't take it for granted.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to pretend I have all the answers or that I always know the right thing to say. But I can promise you this: I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.</p>
        <p>Whatever you need - space, support, someone to just listen - I got you.</p>
        <p>You don't have to go through anything alone anymore unless you want to. And even then, I'll be around when you're ready.</p>

        <p>Before the year comes to an end I wish you a year gentler on your heart, with dreams closer than ever and days more beautiful than you imagine because you deserve every bit of goodness.</p>
        <p>Let's make it count. Try new things. Take some chances. See where life takes us.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, we'll figure it out together.</p>
